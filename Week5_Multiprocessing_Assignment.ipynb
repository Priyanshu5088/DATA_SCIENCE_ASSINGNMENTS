    "Q1. What is multiprocessing in python? Why is it useful? \n",
    "Ans: Multiprocessing in Python refers to the ability of the Python programming language to execute multiple processes concurrently, allowing for better utilization of multi-core CPUs and improved performance for CPU-bound tasks. It's a way to achieve parallelism, where multiple tasks are executed simultaneously to speed up the overall execution time of a program."

    "Q2. What are the differences between multiprocessing and multithreading?\n",
    "Ans: Multiprocessing:\n",
    "1. Imagine you have multiple workers (like different people) working on separate tasks in parallel.\n",
    "2. Each worker has their own tools and workspace (memory), and they don't interfere with each other.\n",
    "3. Suitable for tasks that need a lot of brainpower (computations), and it works well on computers with multiple \"brains\" (cores).\n",
    "4. Good for tasks like complex calculations or simulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multithreading:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Think of multiple friends sharing a single notebook and taking turns writing in it.\n",
    "2. They work on different parts of the notebook at the same time, but only one can write at any given moment.\n",
    "3. Useful when tasks involve waiting, like reading files or downloading data, as one friend can work while others wait.\n",
    "4. Good for tasks like handling many small I/O operations at once."

    "Ans: A multiprocessing pool in Python refers to a collection of worker processes that are managed together and can be used to parallelize and distribute tasks across multiple CPU cores. It's a convenient way to perform parallel processing for a large number of similar tasks without explicitly managing individual processes."
